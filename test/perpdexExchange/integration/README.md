Write a test that assumes an actual situation here

- Write tests using only external interfaces as much as possible
- Check for serious problems without testing for detailed behavior 
- For example, make sure the zero sum isn't broken, the price doesn't change too rapidly, and people who shouldn't be liquidated aren't liquidated.
